Saving the file into server.cnf:
 	Server.saveConfiguration();
		all system properties are looped and saved into server.cnf:
			at the time of server startup (run method)   loadConfiguration() is called.
			This method puts every value of server.conf into system properties by calling - Config.setProperty().
		This implies if anything need to be added/modified has to be put into system properties.
		need to find how new props are added!!! ->  
			Config.setProperty(key, (String)val); line no. 1608
			in side setSettings(){}
		server.cnf is first made empty and then all system properties are added. TODO - Find deleting part of code
			FileOutputStream itself takes care of deletion
			 	FileOutputStream svrcnfOs = new FileOutputStream(confFile);
			if want to append the data in old file then use boolean var true in constructor.
			 	FileOutputStream svrcnfOs = new FileOutputStream(confFile, true);

To make properties visible:
	Add it into special property :  watt.server.extendedSettingsList

Always called setSettings(newsettings) by passing your new settings.
	This will automatically take care of some necessary filtaration + saving to server.cnf
