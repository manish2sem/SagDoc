Jenkins
Jenkins->IS

Look for develop and trunk sections:

	IS_develop_continuous : frequency 4/day
		Continuous just does sanity checking like rike compilation, running Junit etc. 
	IS_develop_publish :	frequency 1-2/day. Used for providing build no. into itrac.
		Publish build, publishes the new build of IS in repo, other than doing sanity checking.		
	IS_develop_scheduled :	frequency 3-4/day 
	IS_develop_trunk_merge : Last build - Nov 30, 2016 

	IS_trunk_continuous : Only two builds are visible 12 and 14 sept.	
	IS_trunk_NLS : frequency 1/day.	 
	IS_trunk_publish : frequency 1/week.		
	IS_trunk_scheduled : frequency 1/week.	

Look for maintainance section only when you are interested on previous versions like 10.1, 9.12 etc.
You will be interested on these sections only when you do the back porting.
Mostly in customer issues which is raised in older version or in some security issues which need to be back-ported in previous few versions.
Unlike dev branch, once this is checked in you can mark them fixed without providing build-no.

*If test case failure is not there that means there is compilation failure.
