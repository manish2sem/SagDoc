package com.wm.util.FacilityInfo;


This is a static helper class for information related to facility codes; product, component, bundle and so on.  

A named constant is defined for each valid facility code and a collection of facility code information is initialized on startup.

This class was previously a static, private inner class in JournalLogger.
It was refactored into a separate class in order to 
1) improve the focus of JournalLogger, 
2) allow direct access to facility information from other logging clases (specifically, the producer used icw the Shared Components Journal Logger).

The facility code is unique and from it we can determine:
	bundle name
	product & component ID
	logger name

The facility code is the major code, and the message code is the minor code.
