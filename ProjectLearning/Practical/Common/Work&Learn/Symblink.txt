Symbolic links are basically advanced shortcuts. 
Create a symbolic link to an individual file or folder, and that link will appear to be the same as the file or folder to Windows.

There are two type of symbolic links: 
 - Soft symbolic links work similarly to a standard shortcut. When you open a soft link to a folder, you will be redirected to the folder where the files are stored.
 - Hard link makes it appear as though the file or folder actually exists at the location of the symbolic link.
Windows  uses the terms “hard link” and “symbolic link” (for soft link).


To create symbolic links use the mklink command in a Command Prompt window as Administrator. 
Locate the “Command Prompt” shortcut in your Start menu, right-click it, and select “Run as Administrator”.

mklink command can create both hard links (known as “hard links” in Windows) and soft links
 
  
  mklink Link Target - creates a symbolic (soft) link at Link pointing to the file Target 
  mklink /D Link Target - to create a soft link pointing to a directory Target  
  mklink /H Link Target - to create a hard link pointing to a file Target  
  mklink /J Link Target - to create a hard link pointing to a directory
  
Note, Folder/File Link should not present. It should be created newly.
